## Checkpoint on  Recursion


#Procedure: ALGORITHM IS palindrome

###Initialization:

####The initial word is set to "kayak," and the algorithm checks if it's a palindrome

- The reverseWord variable is assigned the reversed version of the input word using the reverse_string function.
- Check for Single Character or Empty Space:

- If the length of the word is less than 2 or the word is an empty space, it is considered a palindrome.
- Output a message indicating that the word is a palindrome.
##Compare Original and Reversed Word:

##Compare the original word with its reversed version.
- If they are the same, output a message indicating that the word is a palindrome.
- If they are different, output a message indicating that the word is not a palindrome.
